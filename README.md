# kayolecki.net a resume site

This project is for my personal portfolio for my visual design and code samples. I wanted to give my resume some life and spunk as I'm an artsy person as well as an engineer. I'd like to show whoever is hiring me that I'm more than another engineer. I have passion for everything I do.

## Resources

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.
Some assets from [PRIMENG](https://primeng.org/) are used as well.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

or

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, it will open  to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
Due to the nature of this website not many unit tests are made as there is not many functionally intensive code to test. It's mostly UX/UI designs to showcase my work.
